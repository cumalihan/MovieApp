# MovieApp
The app doesn't have a pagination section because of the limited time. Also, I didn't use any 3rd part library but I implemented CocoaPods. I can use the SnapKit or Kingfisher but I would like to use URL Session for basic apps that can show my code style.

- MVC

- Dark Mode Support

- Programmatic UI

- URL Session

- CollectionView and TableView
